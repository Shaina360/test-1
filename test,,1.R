#1. what is r and r studio

r is  progogram language that act as IDE(integrated development program)

#2. store any value in any variable ...elt(mixbag
mixbag <- c(6,12,17)

#3. what is vector
homologus signle dimensional data structure, that can be change

#4. store value in vector as character,logical and numerical
vec1 <- c(1,2,3)
vec2 <- c("A")
vec3<-c(1,"A",T)
#extract the value from mixbag as store above
mixbag[3]

#5. extrace the character value 
vec2

#6. LIST ;
heterogeneous data structure elememt identify remains same
L1 <-list(1,"A",T)
L1

#7. MATRIX ; 
Homogeneous multidimentional data structure
b <- matrix(c(3:10), nrow = 4, byrow = T)
rownames = c("row1","row2","row3","row4")
colnames = c("col1","col2")
result <- matrix(c(3:10), nrow = 4, byrow = T, dimnames = list(rownames,colnames))
result            

#8. how to create repository?
git login > profile+signin  > new repsotiry > name the repository > crete > copy link > r.studio > file>
  >newproject > version control > git > paste > clone the project

#9.switch directory
session>setworkingdirectory>choose directory > choose directory 

#10. git
version control systen,open source
